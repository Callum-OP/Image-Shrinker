# How to run
Just open the site on the index page (https://callum-op.github.io/Image-Shrinker/) and enter your desired files, choose your desired percentage and click download, 
if you have over 5 images selected they will be put into a zip folder.

# About the app
I made this as I had several large images and needed to decrease their size significantly if I wanted to use them in my game.

# Example Output
<img width="1880" height="868" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f1d3191-dd66-47f7-bc00-dfd929d1795b" />
